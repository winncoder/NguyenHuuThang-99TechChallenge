## Introduction
This module is designed for a learning system where users earn points by completing English lessons. The primary objective of this module is to update the userâ€™s score in real-time, ensuring the scoreboard always reflects the top 10 users accurately. The module also includes security measures to prevent unauthorized score manipulation.

## Scope
Handle score updates only when a user completes an English lesson.

Exclude detailed logic for point calculation (e.g., based on difficulty level or completion time).

Exclude handling of other lesson types.

## Requirements
The website displays a scoreboard showing the top 10 users' scores.

The scoreboard must have live updates.

Users earn points by completing English lessons.

Completing a lesson triggers an API call to update the score.

Security measures must prevent unauthorized score manipulation.

## Technologies Used
NestJS

Prisma

PostgreSQL

Socket.IO

Redis

## Why Microservices?
Scalability: Each service can be scaled independently.

Maintainability: Modular design for easier updates and maintenance.

Reliability: Failures are isolated, reducing system-wide impact.

## Why PostgreSQL?
Timescale Utility: Postgre's Timescale can process time series data very efficiently.

ACID Compliance: Ensures data consistency and integrity.

Performance: Optimized for read-heavy operations like leaderboard queries.

## Why SocketIO?
Real-time communication: Enables live updates without refreshing the page. This satisfies the original request.

Cross-platform support: Works seamlessly on web and mobile platforms.

## Security Considerations
Rate Limiting:Implemented in API Gateway to prevent score manipulation.

Authentication & Authorization: Secures score update endpoints.

Data Validation: Input validation to prevent injection attacks.
